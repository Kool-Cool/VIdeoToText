Storage Limit: The maximum data storage for recorded videos should not exceed 100 MB.


Camera: The app should utilize the phone’s camera for recording videos.


Video Submission: Please submit three videos in vertical format, similar to Snapchat, for review. These videos should showcase the app’s functionality and user interface.


Web Dashboard: The videos must be stored on a web dashboard. The dashboard should be simple and easy to use, allowing for easy access and management of the recorded videos.
